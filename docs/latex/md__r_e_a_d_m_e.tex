\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Protocol offers F\+R\+E\+E\+D\+OM to people.
\item Money -\/ the subject of the Protocol.
\item Capital growth 10-\/1000+\% per month.
\item Automated redistributing system of money, where everyone wins.
\item Mass use. Suggest your friends to sponsor your trip, and gain on it immediately.
\item Fixed percent of loss. Maximum loss is always specified.
\item The Protocol is based on a unique double-\/rate algorithm with overlapping and self-\/quotation.
\item Absolute financial balance. The Protocol is N\+OT a financial pyramid.
\item The game is played by Rounds. Lost in one round -\/ you win back in another.
\item Absolute decentralization. Works on E\+OS operating system.
\item Open source code.
\item Economic mixer. Increases the G\+DP of any country by speeding up financial flows.
\item The Way to the New Age. The Golden Century will come with the everywhere use of the Protocol.

\section*{How it works}

Figuratively, the Protocol can be represented as a rotating Spiral. There is a game fund in the middle of the Spiral, which always has its color -\/ black or white. Completing the turn, the Spiral switches the color of the fund. When the new color of the fund matches with yours -\/ you win, when not -\/ lose. Money can be collected at any time.

 

The twisting movement of the Spiral is given by players, the power of spin and the lasting of the game depend on them. The vertical growth of the Spiral is the increase of benefit, it is set up by the mathematical algorithm. The more turns passed to the stop -\/ the more profitability.

When the rotation stop, all participants receive winnings and losses according to the current selling rates for the winners, and a fixed number of decrease for the loses. Each new tern of the Spiral is called a Round.

 

\section*{How to play}

In the account you will find the control panel. When you select the Participation Protocol branch, you change the gain of winnings with each new round and a fixed percentage of losses. Where there are more losses, the winnings are sweeter.

By clicking on the Deposit button, you enter the game and get the color -\/ the same as the color of the current Round. In order to win, the Round must switch to the next color, and then again -\/ to your. There are no restrictions for the number of deposits; you can have several balances of opposite colors at the same time.

You can withdraw money at any time. If you exit the game on the same round as you entered -\/ you do not lose anything. If on the opposite color -\/ you lose the set percentage of the entry amount. If on your following color -\/ you win according to the prediction defined in advance.

Sooner or later, the extention of the round slows down and stops -\/ and no one knows exactly when it will happen. If the round does not close within the agreed time, for example, for 3 days, then a new cycle of the branch of the Protocol starts -\/ all players get their winnings and losses according to the last color of the round and enter the game anew if they wish. The rules and conditions for the new cycle are saved.

\section*{It is N\+OT a pyramid}

Anyone can check all the algorithms and financial balances of the Protocol, as the code and all the tables are always open. No one can change them, no one can intervene and take the \char`\"{}box\char`\"{} with money, no one can stop the growth of the Protocol.

Since the Protocol is based on a mathematical algorithm and always has a positive financial balance enough to pay 100\% to participants according to established rules, any reproaches about the involvement of the Protocol in the use of the Ponzi scheme can be prosecuted in private, as they do not have no reason.

\section*{Business model for companies and active participants}

Each participant can become an organizer of a branch of the Protocol. The original parameters to any goals and objectives\+It may be regulated, whether it is the speed-\/up of family financial flows, the welfare of a religious sect or the flight to Mars. Just Suggest your friends to sponsor your trip, and gain on it, and probably you will get it already tomorrow.

The Protocol can work for any number of participants and starting capital. It can be considered as a model of collective financing of any engagement, where the participants immediately receive profit, and the organizer -\/ the financial flow for the realization of the dream.
